                    <div class="question-reminder">Is this just another productivity app?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Nope. It's the opposite. Presently isn't here to optimize you — it's here to accompany you. Especially on the days when you feel foggy, frozen, or like your brain hit a wall and bounced.</div>

                    <div class="answer">Not at all. Most rooms are silent by default. Mic and camera are there if you want them. No forced small talk. No "quick intros." Just focus and go.</div>
